<p>RequireJS </p>
<p>The requirejs library is included by the index.html in
<!--  	<script data-main="scripts/app" src="scripts/lib/require.js"></script> -->
This points requirejs to the app startup file
app.js then sets up a base url that require will work from.  
It creates alias names for the various modules it will be injecting (paths)
(Shim) defines aliases to any global variables exported by modules as well as any dependencies that modules have in order to be loaded.
(deps) defines which modules need to be loaded in order for requirejs to work?

One of the deps for this app is ../appbootstrap 
This defines a module in requirejs with several injections that attaches the angularjs app defined in main.js to the DOM on require's domReady event.

Angularjs
	Services are singletons that are persistent on a given page.  When using angular-route this means that a service is persistent accross the whole app.
	A binding made from a $scope to a member of a service is a binding by reference so changes in the service member are automatically represented in the $scope
	Controllers are reloaded by angular-route on each route so their $scope is not preserved.
